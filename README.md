# Hi there, I'm Farid! 👋

### Marine Engineer | AI Enthusiast

I am a 22-year-old final-year **Marine Engineering student** with a passion for bridging the gap between heavy engineering and modern technology. My work focuses on **Educational Technology (LMS)**, **Predictive Maintenance AI**, and **Computer-Aided Design (CAD)**.

Currently, I serve as the **Head of Administration** for the UNESCO JKUAT Adhoc Committee.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🚢 [AIMS (AI Marine Engineering System)](#)
*A Predictive and Preventative Maintenance Model for Marine Engineering.*
- **The Problem:** Optimizing maintenance schedules for marine diesel engines to prevent catastrophic failure.
- **The Solution:** An AI-powered system that uses **LightGBM/XGBoost** models to predict faults.
- **Key Tech:** Uses **SHAP** for explainability (so engineers understand *why* a fault is predicted), wrapped in a **FastAPI** backend with a **React** frontend.

### 🔍 [GlassBox AI](#)
*Glassbox AI analyzes government tenders in real-time using a multi-modal approach that examines both:*
- **Structured data**: Tender value, number of bidders, duration, complexity, PEP involvement
- **Unstructured text**: Tender descriptions analyzed with NLP to detect risk patterns
The system provides instant risk scoring with SHAP-based explainability and AI-generated insights powered by Google's Gemini API.

### 🧑‍🌾 [Kilimo Score](#)
*A machine learning-powered creditworthiness assessment platform for smallholder farmers in Kenya, enabling financial inclusion through intelligent risk scoring.*
#### Key Features
- Alternative Data: Utilizes mobile money, satellite imagery, and SACCO records
- Real-time Scoring: Sub-second prediction latency
- Explainable AI: SHAP-powered feature importance analysis
- PDF Reports: Professional credit assessment reports for loan documentation
- Production Ready: FastAPI backend with Next.js frontend
